# Whatsapp Unsaved numbers

Most of us, at some point of time, need to send a WhatsApp message to numbers not saved in your contact list.
Sadly, WhatsApp app doesn't support this out-of-the box.

This app allows you to easily start a chat with such phone numbers

Being a Progressive Web App (PWA) it can be added to your home screen to be easily accessed when needed.
